### ❌ Limitations - Runtime & Dependencies

- **📦 Browser storage** - Downloads ~300-400MB browsers during install
- **🔧 Runtime dependency** - Requires Node.js 18+ (JS/TS), Python 3.8+, .NET 6.0+, or Java 8+
  - JavaScript/TypeScript implementation is most mature
  - Python, .NET, and Java are officially supported with feature parity
- **💾 Resource intensive** - Parallel tests consume significant memory
- **🗂️ Storage requirements** - Need space for browser binaries

### ❌ Limitations - Ecosystem & Compatibility

- **📖 Learning curve** - Different API from Selenium (migration effort)
- **👥 Smaller community** - Fewer Stack Overflow answers than Selenium
- **🧩 Less third-party tools** - Fewer plugins/integrations currently
- **⚠️ Version compatibility** - Breaking changes between major versions
- **🚫 No IE support** - Only modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **🆕 Relatively new** - Less battle-tested than Selenium (2020 vs 2004)
